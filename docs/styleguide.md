# git workflow
### commit naming
  * maximum line lenght 100 characters
  * for all your commits, make sure that there's an issue for it  
    and start the commit message with the issue-number.  
    Example: '#1 then commit message here'  
    
    Background:  
      * If you use the #<issue number> the commit message will get an  
        automatic link to the referenced issue.  
      * The issue will list all commits made, related to it.  
      
  * if you fix/fulfill an issue, that it can be cloused after your  
    change is merged, use the keywords for automatically close the  
    issue through the commit message.
